My name is Jonathan Johannemann, a 22 year old MIT grad student who loves machine learning algorithms, building a data science narrative with data, and applying these methods to investing.

#### Why is it called Atlas?

The inspiration for the name was derived from Ayn Rand's book Atlas Shrugged which I'm currently reading.
