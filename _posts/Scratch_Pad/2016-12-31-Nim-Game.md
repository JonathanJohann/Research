## LeetCode OJ - Nim Game

So for this [question](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/), we are playing the num game with a friend. For those of you not familiar with Nim, each player takes turns removing 1 to 3 stones off a table. The one who removes the last stone wins.


In this case, we assume that we are taking the first turn to remove the stones.

#### First thoughts:

##### Start with a base case?
Okay, if I'm starting and I can take 1-3 stones. I can just take all of the stones if we start with 1-3 stones.

##### Increment from there.
Okay, for 4. I can pick 1, 2, or 3 and there is always an amount left over that my friend can take and win.
Alright, there can't be 4 if I want to win.
Moving forward, for 5, I want to avoid 4 on my turn so I'm going to just pick one so that my friend has to deal with the problem of having 4 stones remaining.
Same thing for 6...and 7...and 8. Hmm, let's try n % 4 can't be equal to 0.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canWinNim(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return (n%4!=0)
```

And it was correct! This simple solution was also the optimal solution!
