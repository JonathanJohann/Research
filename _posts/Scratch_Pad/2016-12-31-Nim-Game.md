## LeetCode OJ - Nim Game

So for this question, we are playing the num game with a friend. For those of you not familiar with Nim, each player takes turns removing 1 to 3 stones off a table. The one who removes the last stone wins.


In this case, we assume that we are taking the first turn to remove the stones.

#### First thoughts:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canWinNim(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return (n%4!=0)
```
