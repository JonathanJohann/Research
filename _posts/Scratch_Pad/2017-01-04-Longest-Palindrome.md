## LeetCode OJ - Longest Palindrome

So the below is for [Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/).

The objective isto find the majority element or basically the element that appears more than n/2 times in an array of size n.

I tried to keep the code fairly concise. An after thought is that I could've provided some sort of if statement to cut off early if the n value of one of the keys reached a substantial amount or a value greater than n/2.
