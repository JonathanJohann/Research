### Currently:

I am an MIT graduate student.
I am a Graduate Research Assistant at MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems.
I am a Quantitative Research Consultant at WorldQuant.



### How I got into Data Science/Machine Learning?

I started doing research in my sophomore year in college and ran into machine learning and Andrew Ng's course. I was inspired by how one could solve complex problems in such clever ways by using statistics, math, and computer science. I see this integration of different fields of study as a means to solve modern day problems much more efficiently. Some of the really cool projects out there for example are what companies like Uber and Google are doing with autonomous cars and what Google DeepMind is doing with teaching computers to play video games.



### How I got into investing?

I started to see investment management as a viable career path since my first semester of college. I hit the ground running in college with applying to jobs and figuring out what I want to do. Investing seemed like a good personality fit because of its meritocratic, competitive, and highly analytical nature. Later on, after gaining exposure from Point72, WorldQuant, and my own studies, those reasons became a love for the thrill of a fast paced research environment, immediate product feedback (daily profit/loss), and the feeling of discovery when creating a strategy that works.



### What am I looking to do in the near future?

I would like to either be a data scientist at a tech firm or a quantitative researcher or trader at a systematic hedge fund or prop shop. While I do have a love for investing, I would absolutely love to join a tech firm whose product I believe in.



### Hobbies:

Reading: take a look at the reading list tab to see some of my favorites!
Powerlifting/Bodybuilding: love competing against myself to beat personal records.
Meditation: unclutters the mind, helps me focus, and I always feel happy afterwards.
